# ws-navigator_0.5
joomla 3 - modul - pushmenu with login/out first version

This is my first version of a push/pull menu as modul for joomla 3...
for 3d content flip effect you need to wrapp your content, see example index.php of the protostar template.

Don't rename the wrapper classes...

Next steps 
  1. add responsive design to the menu css
  2. add language to empty labels/fields
  3. building a complete template for the modules
  
Installation:
  1. unzip folder
  2. install the mod_wsnavigator.zip as joomla extension
  3. add the scripts and stylesheet to your template root
  4. build in wrapper in your template (see index.php in example folder)
